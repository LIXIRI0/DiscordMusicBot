# DiscordMusicBot

This is a Discord Music Bot created using DisTube and discord.js.

## Installation

1. You need the latest Node.js version for this to work. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   inside the project folder.

2. Next, you need to install FFMpeg. You can access the downloads from [FFMpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
   
   **Important:** You need to add FFMpeg to the PATH on Windows operating systems.

3. After FFMpeg is installed, set up your `.env` file. You can modify the `.env.example` file to suit your needs.

4. Now you can run your bot by executing:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
